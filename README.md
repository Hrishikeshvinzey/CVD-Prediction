# CVD-Prediction
### Cardiovascular(CV) or Heart Diseases are beginning to become more prevalent these days, a plethora of conditions have been described from cholesterol levels to stress levels and many more that could eventually affect a personâ€™s heart. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated about 17.9 million global deaths due to CV diseases (CVDs).
### The focus here is on classification of patients into categories based on whether they are at a risk of developing a heart disease or not, based on different medical parameters/attributes. After analyzing the various medical attributes, we trained a heart disease prediction system/model to help classify the patient for a heart disease. We have used 3 different machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest Hyperparameter tuning  Classifier Model, Ensemble based model consist of Decision Tree, Random Forest Classifier and Support Vector Classifier and XGBoost classification algorithms for prediction and classifying the patient in discussion with a diagnosable heart disease.
